Powershell Modules for Macs!
In the terminal on Mac:

Powershell can be installed via Homebrew in the Mac Terminal.

	Use these commands to install Powershell
	Brew update-reset
	Brew update
	brew cask install powershell
	pwsh
	exit

For the module you will need to install git on the MAC.
	Git –version
      -If you don’t have git on your Mac, running the above command will prompt you to install it.

To download the Powershell module I’ve made:
Create a folder that will become the place for the git repositories, move to that folder, initialize with git, then clone the repo into the folder that was created.
	Mkdir BitBucket
	Cd BitBucket
	Git init
	Git clone https://<repositoryname>

Then to use the module you need to import it to your powershell session. This will need to be done every time you open a new powershell session. Unless you make a profile. Information on creating a powershell profile can be found here.

	Import-profile ./<directory that contains module>/Qualys-Powershell/Qualys.psd1
Before you run any commands you need to authenticate to Qualys with you API account. Then save that into a session variable. Here is the command to get a cookie:
	$cookie = Connect-Qualys –qualysServer “qualysapi.qualys.com” –creds (Get-Credential)

To see what commands are all in the module, use this command:
	Get-Command -Module Qualys

To get the help that I created for each function. Use this command:
	Get-Help <command>

To view a pretty version of help for the commands, please open the file ./Qualys-Powershell/En-US/index.html . This will open a page in your browser with all the native powershell help I build into each function.
